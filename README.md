# Typescript Template project

A basic template for quickly starting up writing code to solve programming puzzles.

# Running the template

* Clone this repository.
* Run `npm install`
* Open the folder in Visual Studio Code.
* Build the code with `ctrl + shift + b`.
* Press `F5`, or run `node index.js` from the terminal.

If you have done all the above successfully, you should see "Hello world!" printed to the console. If so, you're ready to start writing code!
